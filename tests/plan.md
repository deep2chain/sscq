## self-checking points
#### 1. what if priv_validator_key.json is removed in validator nodes? Any bad effects on signing or validating? In security aspect, privs keys should be disconnected to public network.
#### 2. what if node_key.json is removed in validator nodes?
#### 3. what if addrbook.json is removed in validator nodes?
#### 4. what if .hscli is removed in validator nodes?
#### 5. what will happen when validators are upgraded?
#### 6.
