### Distribution
#### Dockerfile
    docker build -f Dockerfile .

    [status]
    dep ensure -v -vendor-only
    fails
    stuck at golang.org/x/crypto because of network issue

### Build Pass Checking
#### circleci
    [status]
    same with the above issue
    -vendor-only flag needs Gopkg.lock generated by dep ensure.
    Now Gopkg borrowed from ethmint doesn't go well with Gopkg.toml.
    Manual Handling still makes troubles

#### travis
    [status]
    Now go-ethereum's used, not customized for this project yet.
